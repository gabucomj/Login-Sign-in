LOVE YOUR FAMILY</h1><h2>
Your Family</h2>

Your family are people, you can depend,
If you get in trouble, they shall defend.
They are the one's that understand,
Always willing to give you a hand.

Your family, you should always cherish,
Without them you would probably perish.
Your connection with them is very deep,
If something happens, together you weep.

You family can help, your confidence build,
With their love and support, you'll feel fulfilled.
Just don't forget to show your appreciation,
That will strengthen your relation.
<h2>
Family Bond</h2>

A family bond is really strong,
They'll accept you, if you're wrong.
Family is there for comfort and support,
Even love you, if you're short.

A family will bring laughter and joy,
Sometimes they just simply annoy.
But that's ok, since they care,
Many things with you, they'll share.

Life without family, wouldn't be the same,
It would be lonely, and definitely lame.
So make sure you thank, each family member,
For being there, from January to December.

If you'd like you may even use one of these verses
for scrapbooking purposes.

You may choose a poem that relates best to your family
situation and add a few family photos or pictures to your scrapbook.

The next lovely poem was submitted by Justice Bullock.
Thank you for sharing it with us Justice.
<h2>
I Love My Family</h2>

I love my family because
they're filled with love
I picture them as angels
from heaven above

I know they love me
and I know they care
our love is so big
but there's enough to share

We're never alone
it will be like that forever
I love my family
we will always be together

I'll admit, I'm not a scrapbooking expert by any means.
 I'm actually very bad at it.

But a few years ago, I did spend 3 full days working on one for my wife. 
It wasn't the prettiest creation, but I guess effort does count, because she loved it.

I think it's really important for family members to help one another.
Whether it's when they are going through a difficult time and are in need 
or with simple but important things such as chores around the house. Years ago,
when my wife and I were living in a small condo, it was really easy to vacuum 
the entire space with our Shark cordless vacuum. Now it takes a bit longer 
with our Miele vacuum that works like a charm.
<h2>
Family Creature</h2>

Family is truly a unique creature,
It can function as an effective teacher.
Each person involved, has plenty to learn,
Through words and actions, respect they may earn.

Sometimes arguments may get pretty loud,
That's because, they're all just so proud.
They better watch what they say,
Otherwise, they'll be lonely and grey.

This creature you should always feed,
You never know, when something you'll need.
The trick is to listen and sometimes talk,
Grab the creature, and go for a walk.
